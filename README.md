- MyCelery: Sailing Together, Apart!

Ahoy there! 🏴‍☠️

Ever felt like you're stranded on a deserted island? Well, not anymore! With MyCrew, it's like Facebook, but way more private and fun! 🎉

I'm building this app, 'cause I miss my hometown buddies from Brazil and want to keep up-to-date, even though we're miles apart! 😄

Here's what you'll love:

🏝️ Private Port: Only you and your close friends are allowed aboard. No strangers, no worries! Your moments are safe with us.

⚓ React based: Powered by React, Next.js, and MongoDB, the tech is as smooth as a calm sea breeze!

📸 Posts: Share your adventures, pics and stories!

🗺️ Map It Out: See where your crewmates are sailing from. Distance can't keep you apart!

Let's keep the friendship alive, no matter how far we roam! 💙
